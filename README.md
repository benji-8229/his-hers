`his-hers` is a pair of identical IoT devices designed for people in medium / long distance relationships to feel more connected.

## How it Works

When you plug one in for the first time, wait and a blue LED should light showing the board is ready to be setup. Open your WiFi settings on phone or computer and join the network `his/hers-setup`. You should be redirected to a page where you can configure the network you want the device to join. After that, simply hit the RST button or unplug and plug it back in.

Each device has a button and a light. Push the button on your board and it will make the light on your partners board flash. They can turn off their light by pressing the button once, and send light to yours by pressing again.

## Development

This project was initially imagined and prototyped in late 2021, but school and life got in the way until now. I decided to restart and finish it now, right on time to give it as a Christmas gift.

The project is running off an `ESP8266 NodeMCU`, and the boards communicate through the `MQTT messaging protocol`. The amount of data transmitted is tiny, small enough we can actually just use free MQTT brokers intended for testing. The only dependency is our Arduino MQTT client, [pubsubclient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient) by Nick O'Leary.

The code behind this is very simple. We start by checking if we can connect to WiFi. If we can't, we open an AP and serve the setup portal to anyone connected. Once we are connected to WiFi we connect to our MQTT broker and subscribe to a topic. When we receive a message in this topic it goes to our callback function which decodes the payload and checks if it was sent from this device or another.
```cpp
void callback(char* topic, byte* payload, unsigned int length) {
  char payloadChars[length+1];
  
  for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    payloadChars[i] = (char)payload[i];
  }
  payloadChars[length] = '\0';
  
  // all payloads sent are just the variable mqtt_user, so if the payload 
  // is different than our mqtt_user it came from a different board
  if (strcmp(payloadChars, mqtt_user) != 0) {
    received = true;
  }
}
```
If the message was from another board, we set `received = true` which turns on our lights. We assign our button a callback function which checks if `received == true`. If it is, it's set to false and lights are turned off. If `received == false` we send our mqtt_user to the topic.

Originally I was planning to host my own MQTT broker off a Raspberry PI, but I realized this was way overkill for the amount of data being sent and the fact that there are just online brokers. I tried HiveMQ because I still wanted a private broker, but didn't care to deal with the certificates and TLS. Also tried Mosquitto, but the traffic was too high and there was high latency. Settled on EMQX because it's free, lower traffic than Mosquitto, and I don't have to mess with certificates. 

I would like to thank **MrDIYLab** on Instructable for his [code and instructions](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Add-a-Setup-Portal-to-ESP8266-Projects/) for the setup portal. HTML/CSS are not my strong suit and this helped me get started much quicker.

After the tech was done I had to decide how to make it a bit nicer, as it was looking a little too homemade. It was also light enough to slide around a desk just from the weight of a cable. I decided on a wooden base to give it weight and a slightly more complete look. After that, drilling a few holes, and assembling, we are done!

## Recreation
### Material List
- [Esp8266 NodeMCU](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Internet-Development-Wireless-Micropython/dp/B010N1SPRK)
- [Diffused Rectangle 5mm RGB LED](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2739)
- [Protoboard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZYNWJ1S)
- Generic Pushbutton
- 22g Solid Wire
- Hobby wood, stain, sanding paper, etc
- [M2 Spacers and screws](https://www.amazon.com/HVAZI-Male-Female-Spacer-Standoffs-Assortment/dp/B071KDS14D)

I don't feel a full instruction list is necessary, and almost anyone with basic development and electronic skills should be able to replicate this. The only things you should need to change in code are the MQTT Topic (each set of devices needs their own topic), the mqtt_user (needs to be unique to each board), and PIN numbers for the LED and button.

## Future

I don't have plans to continue working on this project in any way. I think nice features to add would be more options in the setup portal (changing the broker address, port, and the mqtt_username from the portal would be nice), but as of now that's not necessary. I can also imagine a much more finished project with a larger / more powerful LED, nicer button, and a full 3D printed or wood worked enclosure.
